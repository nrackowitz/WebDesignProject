The role of the Webmaster that I would be the most interested in pursuing is the marketing role. They are responsible for getting public attention for the website, using both search engine optimization and trackers to generate
web traffic. Search engine optimization is when the webmaster designs description and website links to appear easily when searched for online. Finding the keywords that generate peoples attention is a very interesting task to me.
 The trackers are HTML codes that are embedded in the website that identifies where the visitors to the website come from, which pages they visit, when they visit them, and which of them purchase anything or interact with any of the ads.
 These trackers seem fun to set up and code into the website. 

	The biggest draw for this role as a Webmaster is the tie-in to Psychology, in which I am very intersted. You have to know what draws people's attention to your website, and use that to boost traffic. Using the HTML trackers,
you can observe the behavior of visitors of the website, and use that information to tailor the design to better fit the market. You can also see what ads people are more responsive to, meaning that you can pick and choose the more sucessful
adds to stay on the site. Being able to complete all of these tasks requires an understanding of psychology and behavior beyond just the coding side of website building. This gives an extra depth to this side of the Webmaster that I would be 
very interested in pursuing.
